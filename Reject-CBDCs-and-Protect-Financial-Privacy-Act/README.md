WHEREAS, a Central Bank Digital Currency has been defined by the Federal Reserve as a digital form of central bank money that is widely available to the general public; and

WHEREAS, central bank money refers to money that is a liability of the central bank and not of a commercial bank; and

WHEREAS, countries around the world, including the United States, are evaluating whether or not to issue and how to issue and operate a Central Bank Digital Currency; and

WHEREAS, a Central Bank Digital Currency would fundamentally reimagine our banking and financial system by changing the relationship between citizens and the Federal Reserve; and

WHEREAS, a Central Bank Digital Currency would severely undermine financial privacy for consumer and citizens; and

WHEREAS, the availability of a Central Bank Digital Currency in the United States would undermine the important role banks play in financial intermediation; and limit credit availability because funds would move from commercial banks to the Federal Reserve where they cannot be lent back into the economy; and

WHEREAS, a Central Bank Digital Currency would fundamentally rewire our banking and financial system by changing the relationship between citizens and the Federal Reserve; and
